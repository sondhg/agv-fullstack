# AGV Scheduling Implementation Guidelines

## Core Objectives

- Generate intelligent schedules for AGVs
- Ensure collision-free operations
- Prevent deadlock situations
- Optimize AGV routing and task allocation

## Implementation Reference

- Primary algorithms, definitions, and examples are documented in `docs/tex/algorithms-pseudocode.tex`
- All implementations should align with the pseudocode specifications. However, for Algorithm 2, I think it is better to do it like this: Local controllers (AGVs, or simulation program) only need to update their required locations, and the central controller (web server) should do the decision making and data updating.

## Implementation Progress Tracking
$$
Before making changes, always verify:

1. Successfully implemented features
2. Not yet implemented features$$
3. Partially implemented features$$
4. Incorrectly implemented features

## Development Guidelines

1. New implementations must:
   - Follow the pseudocode specifications exactly
   - Include comprehensive error handling
   - Be thoroughly tested for edge cases
2. Modifications to existing code must:
   - Preserve working functionality
   - Fix any deviations from pseudocode
   - Improve incomplete implementations
3. Documentation requirements:
   - Clear comments linking to relevant pseudocode sections
   - Implementation status notes
   - Known limitations or issues
