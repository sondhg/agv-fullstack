Always add code comments to explain the logic and flow of the code.

Always refer to the `algorithms-pseudocode.tex` file in the `docs/tex` folder for the correct implementation of the DSPA algorithm. Always use this file as context.

Always ask for clarification if the instructions are not clear or if you are unsure about something.

Always verify the code after writing it to ensure it works as expected.

Do not alter the code structure or the logic of the code unless explicitly instructed to do so.
