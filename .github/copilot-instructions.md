- Never try to install dependencies. All necessary dependencies are already installed.
- Use .ts and .tsx files for files in `frontend` directory. Do not use .js or .jsx files.
- Do not try to create any new files or directories unless explicitly asked.
- Do not force me to accept your terminal commands. If I click "Cancel" when you give a terminal command, you should continue the conversation instead of stopping and cancelling my request.
