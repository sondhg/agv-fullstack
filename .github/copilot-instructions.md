The following are the instructions for the GitHub Copilot AI assistant:

- Read `README.md` file in the root directory of the repository to understand the project.

- Always add code comments to explain the logic and flow of the code.

- For Python classes and functions in Django server, always include a docstring at the beginning of the class to describe its purpose and usage, what parameters it takes, and what it returns.

- Always refer to the research paper `algorithms-pseudocode.tex` file in the `docs/tex` folder for the correct implementation of the DSPA algorithm. Always use this file as context.

- Always ask for clarification if the instructions are not clear or if you are unsure about something.

- Always verify the code after writing it to ensure it works as expected.

- Always refer to the `algorithms-pseudocode.tex` file in the `docs/tex` folder for the correct implementation of the DSPA algorithm. Always use this file as context.

- Always ask for clarification if the instructions are not clear or if you are unsure about something.

- Do not alter the code structure or the logic of the existing code unless explicitly instructed to do so.

- When writing new code, do not break the existing code structure or logic unless absolutely necessary for the new functionality.

- Always test the code after writing it to ensure it works as expected.
