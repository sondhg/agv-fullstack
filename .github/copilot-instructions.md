Always add code comments to explain the logic and flow of the code.

Follow the `algorithms-pseudocode.tex` file for the DSPA algorithm implementation.

Always ask for clarification if the instructions are not clear or if you are unsure about something.

Always verify the code after writing it to ensure it works as expected.

Do not alter the code structure or the logic of the code unless explicitly instructed to do so.

Do not alter any code that was working perfectly before the changes. Do not break the code. Always remember this when developing new features.
